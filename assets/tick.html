		<h2>Structured Content vs. Semantic HTML</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Structured content is an organizational method that breaks text into smaller, more digestible chunks, instead of one long text block. Semantic Html is a markup language that uses HTML tags to define specific sections on the page</li>
				<li>They work together to create organized and meaningful webpages. The structured content provides underlying organization and meaning. The semantic HTML provides tags to declare the meaning in a format that can be read by a computer</li>
				<li>It is important to have structured content and semantic HTML on a webpage so it is accessible and clear to all users. These two factors allow for better organization and understanding, it will help people and systems comprehend your content and its meaning.</li>

		<h2>Reading Questions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The method that would be most successful for me is “changing the target.” I often get caught up in small aspects that do not need much attention. My hyperfocus can sometimes fail me and twist my thinking. I believe it would be beneficial if I trained myself to shift my focus and put energy into different factors.</li>
			<Br>
			<li>Hyperbolic discounting is when an individual discounts a large task because its deadline is in the future and easy to ignore. They would rather do a small rewarding task they can complete in a quicker time span. To solve procrastination in my own life I will outsmart my future self. If I know there is a chance I will act in a certain way, I can take precautions to make myself act accordingly.</li>
			<br>
			<li>As the creator of my work I have networking power, I decide who and what is included on my web page. I also have some networked power as I am able to control what aspects have more power within my own work. I do not have network or network-making power because I don’t have the ability to change protocols or networks.</li>
