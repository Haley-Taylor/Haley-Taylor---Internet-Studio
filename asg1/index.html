	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>
		<ol>
  			<li>I found it interesting that the evolution of the World Wide Web is divided into three categories. Each category represents a way people view and interact with the internet. Understanding this helps gain a basis on how each stage affected humans and how they evolved.</li>
 			<li>I learned that modern tools can sometimes make web development less impactful. Taking the time to create things yourself allows you to fully understand your work. You can then create stronger designs that hold weight.</li>
			<li>You should always consider accessibility to all users. The design choices you make as well as the tools you choose could affect who is able to access your work.</li>

	<h2>Semester Project</h2>
	<p>
		I would like to create a website that helps college students maintain a healthy lifestyle. It will be informational in order to help them learn important skills. The website would include information on balanced nutrition, stress management, physical activity, mental well being, sleep etc. My goal is to help young adults flourish.
