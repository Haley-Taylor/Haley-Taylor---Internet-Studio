			<h1>Assignment 7</h1>
			<h2>Queen Athena</h2>
			<p>The warrior cat named Athena would make a remarkable ruler. She embodies grace and wisdom like the goddess she is named after. Like the goddess Athena, Athena carries herself with strength and is guided by her intelligence. <br> She will make a good ruler because she is thoughtful and will lead with fairness. Her feline nature teaches her to be curious and careful. Under her rule the kingdom will erupt with harmony and peace.

	 			<p>Athena's running mate would be kitty Hermes, named after the messenger god. Hermes' communication skills perfectly complement Athena's. While Athena embodies justice, Hermes embodies agility and adaptability.</p>
