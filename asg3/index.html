				<li>If you scroll down past the landing page there are three sections labeled “Professional Coaches,” “International Services,” and “Affordable Price.” After analyzing this section I realized “Professional Coaches” and “Affordable Price” are clickable while "International Services” is not. All three sections are only using plain text. There are no indicators on which section is clickable and which is not. <a href="https://roic8.com/" target="_blank">https://roic8.com/</a></li>

                <li>Storytelling is an important part of design, after all you are trying to tell your story and get your message across. Framing it in a story format helps refine the idea by forcing you to clearly define the characters and their experience. The approach makes it simpler and allows the designer to dissect various elements, it turns an idea into a thoughtful narrative. It also allows you to get insight into the user's journey so you can identify positive and negative aspects. This format helps designers and guides them to make successful design decisions.</li>

                <li>You can establish hierarchy in a design by emphasising size, weight, color, style and placement. <a href="https://www.walmart.com/?&adid=22222222220220085369&wmlspartner=wmtlabs&wl0=e&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=521205638070&wl4=aud-2402652640717:kwd-27665750&wl5=9026832&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&veh=sem&wl21=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=316516609&gbraid=0AAAAADmfBIojsyRJAc4uW1-VBD_hoyUct&gclid=CjwKCAjwlaTGBhANEiwAoRgXBa_AL9xNMfyVaSsubeHCq02Qn7GGdvad_zChS6fXqjyLyMHi6TnwwhoCka8QAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Walmart</a> uses hierarchy to place significance in certain areas of the page.</li>
