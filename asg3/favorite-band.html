		<h1>Fleetwood Mac</h1>
		<p>Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band formed in London in 1967 by singer and guitarist Peter Green. Green named the band by combining the surnames of drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie, who have remained with the band throughout its many line-up changes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
		<br>
		<p>I choose this band becuase I have always enjoyed their classic music. They have shifted overtime as a band, but they have remained true to themselves and their fans. I also really enjoy the sound of their voices.</P>
