		<h3>Discussion</h3>
		<p>To begin the discussion I briefly explained the purpose and audience for my webpage. I got an initial response of “hmmm, they all seem good,” so I had to pry a little bit. I asked if there was one they were initially drawn to. They said “welcome-welness.org” stuck out to them, their second choice would be “healthystart.pro.” We then discussed how each name supports the website's theme, so it was difficult for them to decide.</p>
		<p>I personally also like “welcome-welness.org,” the alliteration is pleasing to me. Although I am concerned about the dash. For the purpose of this project I don't think it would affect much, although I don't think I should get used to using dashes. It could be confusing and make it harder to find my website. I think “healthystart.pro” is clear and fitting for my site.</p>
