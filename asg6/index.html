	  <h2>Six Thinking Hats</h2>

	  <h3>White Hat</h3>
	  <p>During this portion of the discussion we were focused on facts pertaining to the health and habits of college students. We identified that many college students struggle to maintain a balanced diet, exercise, and mental well being. This is due to busy schedules and stress. We also looked at existing resources that are offered to these students. We found that a lot of people are unaware of the resources available for them. We did note that I am lacking in specific data to support these points, I need to conduct more focused research into the different topics.</p>

	<div class="red">
	  <h3>Red Hat</h3>
	  <p>Under the red hat portion of the discussion, I was focused on the emotional response of my partner. They acknowledge that these websites sometimes make them feel guilty if they are failing to maintain healthy habits. They also stated that they often question the credibility of these types of websites. This section highlighted a need for a supportive and welcoming tone rather than a clinical one.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="black">
	  <h3>Black Hat</h3>
	  <p>When discussing the black hat section credibility was the focus. They asked me about the extent of medical information I intend to include. After a short discussion we both concluded that it was important I only give wellness advice, not medical advice. Privacy and accessibility were also discussed as an important issue. We discussed the importance of checking sources and making sure we designed an accommodating user interface.</p>

	<div class="yellow">
	  <h3>Yellow Hat</h3>
	  <p>In the yellow hat section we discuss potential advantages of this health website. My partner agreed that this could positively influence students' daily habits by making resources more approachable. The website will build awareness about other campus resources and create a sense of community. It also encourages students to take small steps in improving their health. If done appropriately this could be a very beneficial website</p>

	<div class="green">
	  <h3>Green Hat</h3>
	  <p>During the green hat section our plan was to brainstorm ideas. To address the black hat portion we decided to give the website a welcoming feel. This can be accomplished by adding clean and friendly visuals. They also suggested adding personalization features. A progress tracker could be added to boost motivation. We also discussed adding sections such as a stories feed and possibly a quiz feature to guide students.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="blue">
	  <h3>Blue Hat</h3>
	  <p>The blue hat section wrapped up our discussion. I reflected on the insights I gained, while my partner outlined their main points. We concluded that the main priorities are to create a welcoming space, ensure credible information, and design with empathy and accessibility in mind. This website is addressing difficult topics and I want to ensure I am providing help to students. This stage helped to understand a plan of action.</p>

	  <h2>Reflection</h2>
	  <p>After completing the Six Thinking Hats discussion, the project became much clearer for me. I was able to understand the main goals and get inside the head of my user. Originally, my planning was very generalized, through discussion I was able to understand the defining features of my website. I now plan to make it more personalized and interactive rather than informational. This discussion also highlighted the importance of content, design, and tone. I want to create a project that feels trustworthy and supportive.</p>
