  <h2>Careers Web Page</h2>
  <p class="intro">An ideal job for me would be one that blends creativity with problem solving. I like having the ability to shape how people experience information. I am drawn to roles in design because they allow me to combine my artistic skills with my technical skills. As I finish up school and continue to improve my skills, I will look for roles that align with these skillsets.</p>
